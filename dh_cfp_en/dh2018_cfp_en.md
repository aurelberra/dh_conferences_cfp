## I: GENERAL INFORMATION

The Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations (ADHO) invites
submission of proposals for its annual conference on any aspect of
digital humanities. The theme of the 2018 conference is
“Bridges/Puentes,” and contributions that speak to the theme or that
focus on knowledge mobilization, collaboration among scholars and
scholarly communities, relationships of North/South scholarship and
epistemologies, globalization and digital divides, public-facing and
community-engaged scholarship, translation, digital ecologies, hacker
culture, and digital indigenous studies are especially encouraged.
Possible topics include, but are not limited to:

* Humanities research enabled through digital media, artificial intelligence or machine learning, software studies, mapping and geographic information systems, or information design and modeling;
* Social, institutional, global, gender, multilingual, and multicultural aspects of digital humanities including digital feminisms, digital indigenous studies, digital cultural and ethnic studies, digital black studies, digital queer studies;
* Theoretical, epistemological, historical, or related aspects and interpretations of digital humanities practice and theory;
* Computer applications in literary, linguistic, cultural, archaeological, and historical studies, including public humanities and interdisciplinary aspects of modern scholarship;
* Computational textual studies, including quantitative stylistics, stylometry, authorship attribution, text mining, etc.;
* Digital arts, architecture, music, film, theatre, new media, digital games, and electronic literature;
* Emerging technologies such as physical computing, single-board computers, minimal computing, wearable devices, and haptic technologies applied to humanities research;
* Digital cultural studies, hacker culture, networked communities, digital divides, digital activism, open/libre networks and software, etc.;
* Digital humanities in pedagogy and academic curricula;
* Critical infrastructure studies, media archaeology, eco-criticism, etc., as they intersect with the digital humanities; and
* Any other theme pertaining to the digital humanities.

The conference will be officially bilingual in Spanish and English, so
we invite proposals for presentations particularly in these languages,
as well as in the other languages for which we have a sufficient pool of
peer reviewers (German, Italian, French, and Portuguese, the latter an
important language community of our host region).

Presentations may include:

* Posters (abstract maximum 750 words)
* Short papers (abstract maximum 1 000 words)
* Long papers (abstract maximum 1 500 words)
* Multiple paper panels (500-word abstracts + 500-word overview)
* Pre-conference workshops and tutorials (proposal maximum 1 500 words)

The deadline for submitting poster, short paper, long paper, and
multiple-paper panel proposals to the international Program Committee is
11:59pm GMT-6 (local Mexico City time) 1 November 2017. Presenters will
be notified of acceptance by 16 February 2018.

The deadline for submitting workshops and tutorials, including those
proposed by a Special Interest Group (SIG), is 11:59pm GMT-6 (local
Mexico City time), 15 January 2018, with notice of acceptance by 9
March, 2018.

<https://www.conftool.pro/dh2018/>

When submitting proposals, previous Digital Humanities conference
participants and reviewers should use their existing accounts rather
than setting up new ones. If you have forgotten your username or
password, please contact Program Committee Co-chairs Glen Worthey
gworthey [at] stanford [dot] edu or Élika Ortega e.ortegaguzman
[at] northeastern [dot] edu.

To facilitate the production of the conference proceedings, authors of
accepted papers will be asked to submit final approved versions of their
abstracts via the DHConvalidator, available through ConfTool, which
creates a TEI text base of conference abstracts for further processing.

Presenters are encouraged to familiarize themselves with Global
Outlook::Digital Humanities’ Translation Toolkit to prepare for a
bilingual conference. This includes guidelines and best practices for
multilingual slides/posters/handouts and ad hoc community translation:
<http://go-dh.github.io/translation-toolkit/conferences/>

Similarly, participants are strongly encouraged to make themselves aware
of current recommendations for accessibility of presentations and
multimedia-based materials. Please review the World Wide Web
Consortium's Web Initiative Guidelines on Presentation Accessibility:
<https://www.w3.org/WAI/training/accessible>

## II: TYPES OF PROPOSALS

Proposals may be of five types: (1) poster presentations; (2) short
paper presentations; (3) long papers; (4) multiple-paper panels; (5)
pre-conference workshops and tutorials. Short paper and poster proposals
are especially welcome and, based on peer review and its mandate to
create a balanced and varied program, the Program Committee may offer
acceptance in a different category from the one initially proposed. The
committee will not normally accept more than a total of two submissions
from one primary or co-author. Papers and posters may be given in
English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, or Portuguese.

All proposals should include relevant citations to sources in the
appropriate literature. Citations are not to be included in the word
count. Additionally, proposals that concentrate on a particular tool or
digital resource should cite traditional as well as computer-based
approaches to the problem.

### Poster Presentations

Poster proposals (abstract maximum: 750 words) may present work on any
relevant topic, or offer project tool, and software demonstrations in
any stage of development. Poster presentations are intended to be
interactive with the opportunity to exchange ideas one-on-one with
attendees. Posters are in no way considered lesser forms of presentation
at the DH conference, are subject to the same strict peer review as
other presentation types, and submissions in this category are strongly
encouraged.

### Short Papers

Short paper proposals (abstract maximum: 1000 words) are intended to be
dynamic 10 minute presentations appropriate for reporting on experiments
or works in progress or for describing tools or software in development.
Short paper sessions seek to open dialogues among scholars working on
related topics. Short papers are in no way considered lesser forms of
presentation at the DH conference, are subject to the same strict peer
review as other presentation types, and submissions in this category are
strongly encouraged.

### Long Papers

Proposals for long papers (abstract maximum: 1500 words) should deal
with substantial or completed research; report the development of
significant new methodologies or digital resources; and present rigorous
theoretical, speculative, or critical discussions. Individual papers
will be allocated 20 minutes for presentation and 10 minutes for
questions.

Proposals relating to the development of new computing methodologies or
digital resources should indicate how the methods are applied to
research and/or teaching in the humanities and what their impact has
been in formulating and addressing research questions. They should also
include critical assessments of their application in the humanities as
well as of the computing methodologies used.

### Multiple Paper Panels

Panels (abstract maximum: 500 words for overview, plus 500 words for
each paper) should focus on a single theme and be conceived as 90-minute
sessions of four to six speakers.

Since the conference offers an important occasion to attract new
scholars from diverse backgrounds to specific research areas, those
submitting proposals for panels are advised to ensure that the
constitution of the panel reflects the constitution of the field and/or
research topic that is being addressed and ADHO's expressed commitment
to diversity, or explicitly address problems in those areas. In case the
proposer’s own network is too limited, the Program Committee can advise
them on whom to contact to broaden the panel. Please contact the PC
chairs Glen Worthey gworthey [at] stanford [dot] edu or Élika Ortega
e.ortegaguzman [at] northeastern [dot] edu if you need advice.

### Pre-Conference Workshops and Tutorials

Tutorials are normally half-day intensive introductions to specific
techniques, software packages or theoretical approaches with a small
number of participants. Workshop proposals may take many forms,
including proposals with a full slate of speakers and presentations, as
well as proposals to issue an independent call for papers from which
submissions will be chosen. Participants in pre-conference workshops and
tutorials will be expected to register for the full conference as well
as pay a small additional fee.

Proposals should provide the following information:

* Title and brief description of the content or topic and its relevance to the digital humanities community (not more than 1500 words);
* Full contact information for all tutorial instructors or workshop leaders, including a one-paragraph statement summarizing their research interests and areas of expertise;
* Description of target audience and expected number of participants (based, if possible, on past experience); and
* Special requirements for technical support.

Additionally, tutorial proposals should include:

* A brief outline showing that the core content can be covered in a half-day (approximately 3 hours, plus breaks). In exceptional cases, full-day tutorials may be supported.

And workshop proposals must include:

* Intended length and format of the workshop (minimum half-day; maximum one-and-a-half days);
* Proposed budget (as workshops are expected to be self-financing); and
* If the workshop is to have its own call for participation, a deadline and date for notification of acceptances, and a list of individuals who have agreed to be part of the workshop’s Program Committee.

As with Multi Paper Panel proposals, those submitting proposals for
pre-conference workshops and tutorials are advised to ensure that the
constitution of the panel reflects the constitution of the field and/or
research topic that is being addressed and ADHO's expressed commitment
to diversity, or explicitly address problems in those areas. ADHO's
expressed commitment to diversity, or explicitly address problems in
those areas. In case the proposer’s own network is too limited, the
Program Committee can advise them on whom to contact to broaden the
panel. Please contact the PC chairs Glen Worthey gworthey [at]
stanford [dot] edu or Élika Ortega e.ortegaguzman [at] northeastern
[dot] edu if you need advice.

### Workshops endorsed by an ADHO Special Interest Group (SIG)

Workshops endorsed by a SIG and focused on a topic related to the
concerned SIG are required to follow the same instructions as other
workshops and will be subject to peer review, but will be given special
consideration by the Program Committee.

## III: ADHO CONFERENCE CODE OF CONDUCT

The Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations (ADHO) is dedicated to
creating a safe, respectful, and collegial conference environment for
the benefit of everyone who attends and for the advancement of research
and scholarship in fields supported by our constituent organizations.
The ADHO Digital Humanities conference Code of Conduct is available at
<http://adho.org/administration/conference-coordinating-program-committee/adho-conference-code-conduct>.
All people submitting proposals to DH2018 should observe and uphold it.

## IV: VENUE AND THEME

DH2018 will take place at the [Maria Isabel Sheraton
Hotel](http://www.sheratonmexicocitymariaisabel.com/) in downtown
Mexico City, Mexico, and is hosted jointly by El Colegio de México
(COLMEX), Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM), and Red de
Humanidades Digitales (RedHD). The local organizers are Isabel Galina,
Ernesto Priani, Alberto Santiago Martínez, and Micaela Chávez Villa.
This is the first time that the annual conference will be officially
bilingual in Spanish and English, which aligns with the efforts at
DH2017, the first English and French bilingual conference, and will
benefit accessibility for local scholars and attendees. The theme of
“Bridges/Puentes” underscores the conference’s commitment to making our
organization more global and diverse.

## V: BURSARIES FOR EARLY-CAREER AND EMERGING SCHOLARS

The Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations will offer a limited
number of bursaries for early-career scholars presenting at the
conference. Application guidelines will appear on the ADHO website later
this year: <http://www.adho.org>.

## VI: International Travel Accommodation

For DH 2018 the Program Committee will open a special asynchronous track
for accepted presentations by participants unable to travel to Mexico
City. Proposals should be submitted using the same instructions as all
other proposals; arrangements for video presentations in the
asynchronous track will be made closer to the conference dates for
participants affected by any kind of travel limitation. Presenters in
this track will be asked to produce a video of their accepted
presentation of no more than 10 minutes in length, and will upload it to
a designated channel where it will be published by the conference.
