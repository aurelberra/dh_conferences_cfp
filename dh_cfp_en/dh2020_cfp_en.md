The theme of the 2020 conference is “Carrefours/Intersections,” a place where roads or streets meet. We specifically invite proposals that relate to our sub-disciplinary conference interests: First Nations, Native American, and Indigenous Studies; public digital humanities; and the open data movement. We welcome all who identify themselves as working in the broad variety of disciplines, methodologies, and pedagogies that the digital humanities encompasses.

Submissions will be evaluated based on:
Overall organization and clarity of proposed submission (20%)

Thematic relevance to “carrefours/intersections”: Native American, Indigenous, and First Nations Studies; public digital humanities; or the open data movement (10%)
Clear theoretical, methodological, or pedagogical framework and explicit statement of purpose (20%)
Applicability, significance, and value of the theoretical, methodological, and/or practical contribution to the digital humanities generally (20%)
